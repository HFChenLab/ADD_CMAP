# ADD-CMAP.py
## Add CMAP parameters into original AMBER prmtop file

Inorder to obtain a accurate descripion of intrinscally disorder proteins(IDPs) ensembles, grid-based energy correction maps (CMAP) method
<sup>[1]</sup> was applied in MD simulation to improve the sampling of backbond dihedrals of IDPs which have high heterogeneous conformers.
Therefore, several IDP-sepcific force fields were developed based on the classical AMBER force fields by adding CMAP energy terms in MD
simulations, such as ff99IDPs<sup>[2][3]</sup>, ff14IDPs<sup>[4]</sup>, ff14IDPSFF<sup>[5]</sup>.  

This script is used to add CMAP parameters into the prmtop file which is generated by tleap module embedded in AMBER packages.  

Usage: python ADD-CMAP.py -p amber.prmtop -c CMAP_parameters -o amber_CMAP.prmtop -s  

    -p    prmtop files generated by tleap with leaprc.ff99SB (if you want ot use ff99IDPs) and leaprc.ff14SB (if you want ot use ff14IDPs and ff14IDPSFF)  
    -c    CMAP parameter file
    -o    prmtop files within CMAP parameters
    -s    silent mode
